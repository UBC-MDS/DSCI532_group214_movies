Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

We would like to explore how the movie industry has developed over time, particularly regarding revenue streams, both domestic and worldwide, with respect to different genres. The film industry creates and provides entertainment for millions of people worldwide, and is worth a staggering amount of money. The global box office of all films in 2018 was over 41 billion USD, with almost 12 billion USD in just the US alone. This could be of particular interest to someone in the industry in Vancouver, as many movies -- blockbusters and indie films alike -- are shot in Vancouver; with production companies spending around 3.5 billion in 2018 in BC. This app would help illustrate the trends in consumer tastes in film, through box office figures, perceived quality by the audience through IMDB ratings, and how they are correlated with each other. Different filters and options provide ease of access to subset the data as the user likes.
