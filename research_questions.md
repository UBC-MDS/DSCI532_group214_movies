### Research Questions:

What genre has been most profitable in the last five years?

How much does critical reception affect profit? What about audience reception?

What genre of movie is the cheapest to produce? How profitable is it?

Stanley Spielberg is a young executive at a film studio. Every day he is tasked with making decisions over which movies should be made. The film studio is fairly new and doesn’t have as many resources as some of the other bigger companies in the industry so he needs to make smart decisions quickly about how profitable a film might be. When he looks at his “Movie Profitability Dashboard”,  he can see information on box office returns (how much money a movie made in the US) and he can filter by domestic (US) or international box office to get a better understanding of where he might want to focus marketing efforts. He can also look at information on budgets, profits, and profit ratios filtered by genre, year, and month to see how likely a certain movie might perform at a certain time. He can also see how important critical and fan reception is, so he’ll be able to gauge whether or not he should spend more money on better actors and directors.

For example, Stanley might notice that superhero films appear to be incredibly popular, but he wants to know how profitable they are. When he filters the data to show only the most recent ten years, he would see that they do get the highest box office returns, but the budgets are also huge compared to other genres. Therefore, the movies tend to be either very profitable or very unprofitable. This kind of variation in profit indicates a high risk that might not want to take as a new executive at a small studio.
