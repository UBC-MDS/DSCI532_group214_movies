What genre has been most profitable in the last five years?

How much does critical reception affect profit? What about audience reception?

Stanley Spielberg is a young executive at a film studio. Every day he is tasked with making decisions over which movies should be made. The film studio is fairly new and doesn’t have as many resources as some of the other bigger companies in the industry so he needs to make smart decisions quickly about how profitable a film might be. When he looks at his “Movie Profitability Dashboard”,  he can see information on box office returns (how much money a movie made in the US) and he can filter by domestic (US) or international box office to get a better understanding of where he might want to focus marketing efforts. He can also look at information on budgets, profits, and profit ratios filtered by genre, year, and month to see how likely a certain movie might perform at a certain time. He can also see how important critical and fan reception is, so he’ll be able to gauge whether or not he should spend more money on better actors and directors.
