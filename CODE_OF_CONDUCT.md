## Part 1. Introduction

Group 214 values the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Group 214 activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Group 214 including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

Group 214 Code of Conduct Committee is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. It can be contacted by submitting an issue [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_group214_movies/issues). All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential.

## Part 2. Group 214 Code of Conduct

Group 214 is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to anyone. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone who participates in Group 214 activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by Group 214 including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which Group 214 resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.

### Part 2.1 Expected behaviour

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all Group 214 events and platforms:

    Use welcoming and inclusive language

    Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences

    Gracefully accept constructive criticism

    Focus on what is best for the community

    Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the four social rules for further recommendations.

### Part 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any Group 214 event/platform include:

    written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group

    causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation

    violent threats or language directed against another person

    the display of sexual or violent images

    unwelcome sexual attention

    nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact

    sustained disruption of talks, events or communications

    insults or put downs

    sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes

    excessive swearing

    incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm

    continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop

    publication of private communication without consent

### Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any Group 214 events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage Group 214 Code of Conduct Committee to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.
