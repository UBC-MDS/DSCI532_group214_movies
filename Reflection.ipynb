    "3. The first graph could be slightly reworked to be a dodged bar chart or a faceted bar chart to make the comparison between domestic and international box office more clear. There were also suggestions to implement a local filter to see only domestic or only international box office if they so choose. Some thought the graph was too US centric and the option to include gross from other countries/continents would be nice.\n",

    "4. There were suggestions for the second graph to be interactive, and allow filtering based on genre to be done on all the graphs by selecting a bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The heatmap is too scarce to be used on less popular genres and on smaller year ranges. Suggestion to make the bin width smaller so the data appear to be more dense, or to scrap the heatmap entirely for possibly a boxplot or line chart.\n",

    "**Reflection on Feedback**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on how people dove into using our app, we would say that functionality wise our app is very intuitive, with 2 simple filters that globally change the charts/text. However some thought that the it was unclear that the summary text was dynamic. People used the app in the way we expected, overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common opinions include the scarcity of the heatmap under certain selection criteria, the desire for the filtering of domestic/international box offices in the boxplot, and just making the dynamic text fit in with the rest of the app better. People also desired interactivity of the graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the graph type or graph parameters slightly is reasonable and doable in a short timeframe. Adding another filter option for one graph is also reasonable, although it may affect the layout more than anticipated. Adding interactivity would be somewhat more difficult and time consuming. Requests like the inclusion of box office figures from other countries specifically or continents is not possible with our current dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we were generally aware of the strengths and weaknesses of our app in its current state, the feedback we received was overall quite useful and helped us create priorities for what changes we want to make. The fly on the wall portion for more complex apps could be very useful to see what people find intuitive and what isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall we believe that the feedback activity helped lead to an improved and more user-friendly app."
