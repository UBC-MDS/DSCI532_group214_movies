### Describe the dataset:

Who: The movies dataset is from the Vega dataset library, but I could not find anymore detailed information about which organization collected or organized the data.

What: In this dataset, there is a collection of movies and information about those movies. The information is box office returns from the US and from around the world, US DVD sales numbers, the production budget of each movie (how much each movie cost to make, the running time of each movie in minutes, the "Rotten Tomatoes" rating, a score that tells you what percentage of critics who saw the movie liked it, IMDB Rating, which is the score from users of the website IMDB, and the release date (presumably the US release date).

When: The data contains movies from 1915 to 2010 and incomplete information on a couple movies from 2011. There are some movies listed incorrectly as being released beyond 2015, but they are off by 100 years.

Why: It seems like the purpose of the dataset is for people who are interested in movies to have a source of data where they can look up information easily.

How: As to how the data was collected, I could not find information on that.
